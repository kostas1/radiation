Linux support for IRI-1 gamma counter
=====================================

This userspace tool is very dependant on TS-7800 hardware at the
moment. And this depends on IRI-1 gamma counter which was produced in
Estonia during Soviet occupation. :-D

If you happen to have one, change parameters in MeasureRadiation.hs and go!


Compiling
---------

ghc --make MeasureRadiation.hs


Running
-------

$ ./MeasureRadiation

The format used is comma-separated values of UNIX timestamp and intensity.

The unit of intensity is Âµc/s (micropulses per second). That's totally
uncalibrated unit depending on the meter you are using. You can get it to
Sv/h by doing some magical calibration, calculation, and stuff.

When the radiation levels get too high, take your iodate pills and have fun.
